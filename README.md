# 📄 Simple RAG Streamlit App Using GROQ + SentenceTransformer

A clean, hands-on implementation of a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system built from scratch using familiar Python tools:

- PDF text extraction with **PyMuPDF**
- Sentence-aware chunking and embeddings with **SentenceTransformer**
- Semantic search via cosine similarity
- GROQ LLM API for fast, grounded answer generation
- Streamlit app for effortless PDF QA interaction

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Prototype in Notebook: `rag_using_groq.ipynb`

- Extract text from PDFs with **PyMuPDF**
- Split text into meaningful sentence-aware chunks for semantic coherence
- Generate chunk embeddings using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` SentenceTransformer model
- Perform semantic search with cosine similarity to identify relevant chunks per query
- Call GROQ LLM API with retrieved context for accurate, grounded responses
- Tune chunk sizes, overlap, and prompt engineering for best performance

### 2. Productionize in Streamlit: `app.py`

- User uploads a PDF document
- App extracts and chunks the text, caching embeddings for efficiency
- User asks questions via the UI
- Semantic search finds top relevant chunks
- GROQ LLM generates answers based on those chunks
- UI shows answers and the context chunks used for transparency

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/sbshihab24/simple-rag-streamlit.git
cd simple-rag-streamlit
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set your GROQ API Key:
Create a .env file in the root directory with:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

Or export the key in your shell:

export GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key_here"
Get your API key here: https://console.groq.com/keys

⚡ Run the App
streamlit run app.py

##🔍 Core Concepts
Sentence-Aware Chunking: Preserves semantic integrity of text chunks

Embeddings: Converts text to vector representations for semantic similarity

Semantic Search: Finds best matching chunks to your query

GROQ LLM API: Answers questions based on retrieved context for reliable, grounded responses

Caching: Efficiently loads models and caches embeddings

Streamlit UI: Simple interface for PDF upload and question answering

    "# This script implements a complete Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.\n",
    "# It uses the Groq API for ultra-fast language model inference and a local,\n",
    "# open-source SentenceTransformer model for creating text embeddings.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Pipeline Steps:\n",
    "# 1.  Load Data: Extracts text from a specified PDF file.\n",
    "# 2.  Chunk Data: Splits the extracted text into smaller, overlapping chunks.\n",
    "# 3.  Embed Chunks: Converts text chunks into numerical vectors (embeddings).\n",
    "# 4.  Semantic Search: Finds the most relevant chunks based on a user query.\n",
    "# 5.  Generate Response: Sends the query and relevant chunks to a Groq LLM\n",
    "#     to generate a context-aware answer.\n",
    "# 6.  Evaluate Response: Uses a second Groq LLM call to score the answer\n",
    "#     against a predefined ideal response.\n",
